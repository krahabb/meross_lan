    MQTT publishing rate-limiter x device (in order to prevent Meross account ban):
    The algorithm tries to limit the rate of publish to
    less than MAXQUEUE over a period of DURATION for every single device.
    If a new publish request is submitted when more than MAXQUEUE
    messages have been sent over DURATION, it gets discarded.
    This algorithm has been put in place in 5.1.0 upgrading the previous
    'hard' rate-limiting which set the rate-limiting x connection (so all of
    the devices shared the same timings). Also, the previous algorithm was
    attempting queueing the messages in order to lower the publish rate over
    quick burst but this seemed to lead to message rejection at the device
    (at least on a recent msl320) and my guess is the device is trying to prevent
    message spoofing by rejecting messages too old in time (a few seconds for that msl320)

    In this discussion (https://github.com/krahabb/meross_lan/discussions/545#discussioncomment-12678003)
    There's a statement from Meross regarding data rate:
    "Important Requirement:
    To ensure optimal performance and security,
    please limit your device's communication to no more than 200 messages every one hour."

    TODO
    Taking this into account, we should set the rate-limiting to 1 message every 18 seconds
    on average but I guess the short term burst should be allowed (up to 6 messages in 60 seconds)
    We should eventually setup also a long-term data rate-limiting (e.g. 200 messages in 1 hour)
